International Ozone Services Inc. is introducing new full release of the Brewer operating software version 3.78.
There are important changes and improvements to the way the program behaves and to what information 
is saved in the b-files.

The following changes have been made:
	1. We have decided to save some memory by removing comments from the code in the main program. 
	   This is now done by using line number 55555 for all comments. Since GWBasic interpreter overwrites lines with the same line number,
	   only the last such line is left when the code is loaded, thus saving the memory.
	   We suggest using line number 55555 for all comments and NEVER use this line number for code since it will be lost.
	2. The the automatic HG/HP/FR can now be switched ON or OFF in the main program using one of the following methods:
		a) calling auto-off (or auto-on) command from the main menu
		b) changing the value of AUTOHG variable to 1 (ON) or 0 (OFF) 
		b) editing line 4 of the main program to change the initial value of AUTOHG variable
	3.	the program now has a new string variable, VER$, that holds the program version value. It is initialized on line 5
	4. 2 new commands are introduced, 'saveall' and 'savedh', saveall saves all constants into the bfile and savedh saves the day header plus all constants
	5. automatic neutral density filter selection is now done based on the maximum intensity between all slits, not just slit 4
	6. Another option that has been introduced in this release is the way the automatic neutral density filter selection behaves.  
		There are two new variables in the program, UATTN! and LATTN!, which control when the oscillation mode (when the program 
		uses two neutral density filters alternatively) start.  LATTN! sets the lower limit on the higher attenuation filter and 
		UATTN! sets the limit on the lower attenuation filter.

        For example:  the original values for the automatic ND filter selection were 25000 and 80000, these being the number of counts 
        accumulated in one observing cycle.  Converting these numbers to counts per seconds (c/s) gives 426000 c/s and 1363000 c/s, so 
        the oscillation mode happened when the higher attenuation filter gave a rate less than 426000 c/s and the lower attenuation 
        filter gave the rate greater than 1363000 c/s.  Because the nominal ratio between two adjacent ND filters is approximately 3.1 
        and the ratio of 1363000/426000 is 3.19, the oscillation mode usually took place over a very short time interval.  
        During the El Arenosillo, Spain, Brewer intercomparison campaign in July, 2011 it was discovered that a combination of 
        small slant amount of ozone (airmass * ozone column) and low count rate can produce very noisy, and thus unreliable, 
        ozone observations.  This situation occurs when the neutral density filter that is automatically selected for DS observations 
        for most of the mid_day measurements attenuates more than a factor of 1/3.1 compared to the one step lower attenuation filter 
        in filter wheel 2.  In this case, the number of c/s will be very low and since the airmass values in the middle of the day are small, 
        the slant ozone amount is small leading to a small ozone absorption signal with an imprecise observation because of the low count rate.

	This situation can be improved by having a more accurate spacing of the attenuating filters, particularly for those with larger attenuations. 
	However, if the DS observations are made with alternatively higher and lower attenuation filters there is a significant improvement in the overall 
	statistics of accepted results.  This mode also provides information that can be used to compare the performance of the neutral density filters by 
	collecting observation pairs on adjacent filters.  Setting LATTN! to 50000 and UATTN! to 70000 increases the duration of the oscillating interval in the 
	DS observations.  The higher count rates provide useful ozone information only if the counting system is sufficiently fast and the characterization of the 
	dead time and dead time function is accurate.
