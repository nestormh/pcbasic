<h2 id="settings">Settings and options</h2>
<p>
    PC-BASIC has a number of settings that change the way it operates.
    These settings can be changed by setting options on the command line
    or through editing the configuration file.
</p>
<p>
    In either method, the options have the same name and syntax. In what follows, we will often refer to
    a particular option setting; remember that you can set this from the command line as well as from the configuration file.
</p>
<h5>Command-line options</h5>
<p>
    You can enter command-line options if you start PC-BASIC from the console
    (also known as the <em>Command Prompt</em> or <em>Terminal</em>;
    this is normally <code>CMD</code> or <code>PowerShell</code> on Windows),
    by preceding the name of the option
    with two dashes, like so:
</p>
<code class="block"><b>pcbasic <a href="#--preset">--preset</a>=tandy <a href="#--ctrl-c-break">--ctrl-c-break</a>=True</b></code>
<p>
    On the command line, you can leave out the expression <code><b>=True</b></code>
    that is common in switching options.
    Some options have an alternative, short name consisting of a single
    letter preceded by a single dash, which you can use on the command line.
    You can combine multiple short options with a single dash.
</p>
<h5>Configuration files</h5>
<p>
    You can change options by adding or removing lines in your local configuration file,
    which can be found in the following location:
</p>
<dl>
    <dt>Windows</dt><dd><code>%AppData%\pcbasic\PCBASIC.INI</code></dd>
    <dt>OS X</dt><dd><code>~/Library/Application Support/pcbasic/PCBASIC.INI</code></dd>
    <dt>Linux</dt><dd><code>~/.config/pcbasic/PCBASIC.INI</code></dd>
</dl>
<p>
    Change an option in the configuration file by adding a line in the section named <code>[pcbasic]</code>, like so:
</p>
<code class="block">
    [pcbasic]<br/>
    <a href="#--preset">preset</a>=tandy<br/>
    <a href="#--ctrl-c-break">ctrl-c-break</a>=True
</code>
<p>
    You cannot use  <a href="#parameters">positional arguments</a> or
    the short name of options in the configuration file.
    You also cannot leave out the expression <code><b>=True</b></code>.
</p>
<p>
    The configuration file should be a text file encoded in ASCII or UTF-8.
</p>
